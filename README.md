<h1>ðŸš€ Space ðŸ‘¾</h1>

<p>
Space is a fun, arcade-style web game. In each level, your goal is to survive alien attacks for 60 seconds. If you succeed, youâ€™ll move on to the next level.

In the top-left corner of the screen, youâ€™ll see the flicker bar. By holding the "F" key, you can activate your flicker ability. Flickering lets you pass through obstacles without dyingâ€”but use it wisely, as it takes a while to recharge.
