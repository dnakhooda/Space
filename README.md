<h1>🚀 Space 👾</h1>

<p>
🚀 Space 👾 is a fun, arcade-style web game. In each level, your goal is to survive alien attacks for 60 seconds. If you succeed, you’ll move on to the next level.

In the top-left corner of the screen, you’ll see the flicker bar. By holding the "F" key, you can activate your flicker ability. Flickering lets you pass through obstacles without dying—but use it wisely, as it takes a while to recharge.
